\section*{Brief}

I launched my career on developing embedded devices using Unix-like kernel at Ricoh Company, Ltd. The experience was not only for designing device drivers but also including debug of virtual memory. And I have experience in IoT platfom such as ARM Cortex-M MCU and RTOS. Also I learned application design using functional language such as Haskell\footnote{\href{https://www.haskell.org/}{\tt https://www.haskell.org/}}, and published some research papers\footnote{\href{http://www.metasepi.org/papers.html}{\tt http://www.metasepi.org/papers.html}} about such languages.

I would like to continue to pursue quality improvement technologies (including security) regardless of the software layer.

\section*{Skill Sets}

\subsection*{Deep knowledge for Unix-like Kernel and User Space}

I am an expert for Unix-like kernel such as Linux, because I provided technical support for NetBSD\footnote{\href{http://netbsd.org/}{\tt http://netbsd.org/}}, which is a Unix-like OS similar to Linux, at Ricoh. My skill is not only for NetBSD but also Linux. In fact, a race condition bug in PowerPC Linux kernel was fixed by me in only five days at MIRACLE LINUX.

\subsection*{Wide experience in IoT platform}

I have a wide experience in IoT platform such as FreeRTOS, ChibiOS/RT\footnote{\href{http://www.chibios.org/}{\tt http://www.chibios.org/}}, ARM Cortex-M, ESP8266, AVR and MSP430. Also I launched a new IoT business using TWELITE wireless platform\footnote{\href{https://mono-wireless.com/}{\tt https://mono-wireless.com/}} at Centillion Japan.

\subsection*{Research Security and Quality}

A prototype of own Secure-OS similar to OP-TEE\footnote{\href{https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee\_os}{\tt https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee\_os}} was designed by me at SELTECH. It runs with the other RTOS on ARM Cortex-M MCU. Also I have a wealth of experience in strong static typing language such as Haskell and verification of C language such as VeriFast\footnote{\href{https://github.com/verifast/verifast}{\tt https://github.com/verifast/verifast}}, which are useful to keep the quality of products.

\section*{Computer Skills}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Languages: C (12 years), Haskell (5 years), Intel/ARM assembler (5 years), Ruby (5 years), C++ (3 years), PHP (2 years), OCaml (2 years), SQL (1.5 years), Python (1 year), Erlang (1 year), JavaScript (1 year), R (1 year), Go (0.5 years)
  \item Platforms: Linux (15 years), NetBSD (12 years), Cygwin (2 years), FreeRTOS (1.5 years), ChibiOS/RT (1.5 years), Android NDK (1 year), MinGW (1 year), Yocto (1 year)
  \item Database: MySQL (2 years)
